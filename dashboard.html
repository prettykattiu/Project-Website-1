            Clean the squid by removing the insides and skin. Cut into rings about 1/2 inch thick.
            Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.
            
            2. Make the Battering Mix:
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika (optional).
            Add the beaten egg and cold water to the dry ingredients. Mix until the batter reaches a smooth consistency.

            Dip each squid ring into the batter, ensuring it is fully coated.
            
            4. Heat the Oil:
            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. Make sure there’s enough oil to submerge the squid rings.
            
            5. Fry the Calamares:
            Once the oil is hot (you can test by dropping a small amount of batter into the oil—it should sizzle immediately), carefully drop the battered squid rings into the hot oil.
            Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.
            Remove the fried squid rings and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

            3 cloves garlic, minced,

            Chicharon (crushed pork cracklings), for garnish (optional)"
            data-good_for = "Good for 4 to 6 person."
            data-procedure="1. Prepare the Pork:
            Begin by boiling the pork belly and pork face (if using) in a pot of water. Add salt to taste. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the pork is tender. If using pork belly only, cook it for the same amount of time until it’s tender but not falling apart.
            
            2. Grill the Pork:
            Once the pork is cooked and tender, remove it from the pot and allow it to cool slightly. Then, grill the pork over medium heat until the edges are crispy and charred. Alternatively, you can broil the pork in the oven or use a cast-iron pan to crisp it up.
            
            3. Chop the Pork:
            After grilling, chop the pork into small bite-sized cubes. You want them to be crispy and a bit chunky for texture.
            
            4. Sauté Aromatics:
            Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the chopped onions, garlic, and bird’s eye chilies until the onions become translucent and the garlic is fragrant. This should take about 2-3 minutes.
            
            5. Add the Pork:
            Add the chopped crispy pork to the skillet with the sautéed onions and garlic. Stir-fry the mixture for another 2-3 minutes to ensure the pork is well combined with the aromatics.
            
            6. Season the Sisig:
            Season the pork mixture with soy sauce, vinegar, calamansi (or lemon/lime) juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir everything well, and let it simmer for another 3-5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. If you like your sisig tangier, feel free to add more vinegar or calamansi juice.
            
            7. Optional Creamy Version:
            For a creamy version, add 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise and mix well. This gives the sisig a rich, smooth texture.
            
            8. Topping with Egg:
            If you’d like to top your sisig with an egg, create a well in the center of the sisig and crack an egg into it. Let it cook in the skillet until the egg whites are set but the yolk remains runny, or cook it to your preferred doneness.
            
            9. Garnish:
            Optionally, garnish your sisig with crushed chicharon (pork cracklings) for added crunch and flavor.
            
            10. Serve:
            Serve your sisig hot, ideally on a sizzling plate. Pair it with steamed rice, and enjoy the crunchy, savory, and tangy flavors!">

            2. Wrap the Cheese:
            Lay a spring roll wrapper flat on a clean surface.
            Place one cheese stick at the edge of the wrapper.
            Roll the wrapper tightly around the cheese stick, folding in the sides as you go, to form a sealed roll.
            Brush the edge of the wrapper with the beaten egg to seal it shut.
            
            3. Heat the Oil:
            Heat oil in a frying pan or deep fryer over medium heat. You need enough oil to submerge the cheese sticks, but not too much that it overflows.
            
            4. Fry the Cheese Sticks:
            Once the oil is hot (about 350°F or 175°C), carefully add the wrapped cheese sticks into the oil.
            Fry the cheese sticks in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
            Fry for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. The cheese should melt inside while the wrapper crisps up.
            
            5.Drain Excess Oil:
            Remove the cheese sticks from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.

            Clean the pork belly thoroughly and cut it into 2-inch wide strips.
            
            2. Boil the Pork:
            In a large pot, combine water, salt, ground black pepper, garlic, and bay leaves.
            Add the pork belly to the pot and bring the water to a boil.
            Lower the heat and let it simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours or until the pork is tender.
            
            3. Dry the Pork:
            Remove the pork belly from the pot and let it cool.
            Once cooled, pat the pork dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This step is important to achieve a crispy texture during frying.
            
            4. First Frying:
            Heat the cooking oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
            Fry the pork belly until it turns light golden brown (about 5–7 minutes). Do not overcook at this stage.
            Remove the pork and let it cool completely. This step helps render some of the fat and prepares it for the final fry.
            
            5. Final Frying:
            Heat the oil again, this time over high heat.
            Fry the pork belly until it becomes crispy and golden brown. This should take about 5–7 minutes.
            Be cautious as the oil may splatter due to the fat content.
            
            6. Serve:
            Let the bagnet rest on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.

            Dip each onion ring into the dry flour mixture, ensuring it is fully coated.
            Next, dip the floured ring into the wet egg and buttermilk mixture, allowing any excess to drip off.
            Finally, coat the ring in breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere the breadcrumbs evenly.
            
            6. Preheat the Oil:
            Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or pot to about 350°F (175°C). Use enough oil to submerge the rings fully.
            
            7. Fry the Onion Rings:
            Working in batches, fry the onion rings in the hot oil until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.
            Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried rings to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
            
            8.Serve:
            Serve the crispy onion rings warm with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ketchup, ranch, or aioli.">

            data-procedure="1. Roast the Eggplants:
            Using a grill, stovetop, or oven, roast the eggplants until the skin is charred and the flesh becomes soft. You can do this directly on a gas flame or under a broiler, turning them occasionally until they are cooked through. Alternatively, you can roast them in an oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes.
            
            2. Peel the Eggplants:
            Once the eggplants are cooked, let them cool slightly before peeling off the charred skin. The skin should easily peel off, revealing the soft, tender flesh inside.
            After peeling, gently mash the eggplant using a fork or your hands, making sure to leave it chunky (don’t over-mash). Set aside.

            If you are using ground pork or beef, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion, and sauté until softened and fragrant.
            Add the ground pork or beef and cook until browned and fully cooked through. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and add soy sauce if desired. Set aside to cool.
            
            4. Prepare the Egg Mixture:
            In a large bowl, crack the 3 large eggs and beat them until well combined. Add the mashed eggplant to the eggs and mix until the eggplant is evenly distributed throughout the egg mixture.
            Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            
            5. Cook the Tortang Talong:
            Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
            Pour the eggplant-egg mixture into the pan, spreading it out evenly. If using ground meat, you can sprinkle the cooked pork or beef mixture on top of the eggplant mixture or mix it in.
            Cook the omelette for about 4-5 minutes on the first side, until the bottom is golden and crispy.
            Gently flip the omelette over using a spatula or by sliding it onto a plate and flipping it back into the pan. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown and the eggs are fully set.

            data-good_for = "Good for 4 person."
            data-procedure="1. Prepare the Crabs:
            Clean the crabs and cut them into pieces. You can either break them down into halves or smaller chunks, depending on your preference. Make sure to remove any unwanted bits and clean the insides thoroughly.
            
            2. Prepare the Sauce:
            In a small bowl, mix the chili paste (or chili sauce), tomato ketchup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, chicken broth (or water), sugar, and salt together. Stir well to combine, ensuring all the ingredients are dissolved and form a smooth sauce.
            
            3. Heat Oil and Sauté Aromatics:
            Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.
            Add the minced garlic and minced ginger to the oil. Sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn them.
            Add the finely chopped red chilies and sauté for another 30 seconds. This will infuse the oil with chili flavor.
            
            4. Cook the Crab:
            Add the crab pieces to the wok and stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally, until they begin to turn orange and are lightly cooked on the outside.
            
            5. Add the Sauce:
            Pour the prepared sauce mixture into the wok with the crab. Stir everything together, making sure the crab is evenly coated with the sauce.
            Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the crab to cook fully and absorb the flavors from the sauce.
            
            6. Thicken the Sauce:
            In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to form a slurry.
            Gradually add the cornstarch slurry to the sauce while stirring continuously. This will help thicken the sauce.
            Allow the sauce to simmer for another 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.
            
            7. Add the Eggs:
            Slowly pour the lightly beaten eggs into the sauce while stirring gently. The eggs will cook and form silky strands in the sauce, adding richness and smooth texture.
            Stir gently and let the eggs cook for about 2 minutes.
            
            8. Final Seasoning Adjustments:
            Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add more salt, sugar, or vinegar to balance the flavors according to your preference.
            
            9. Garnish and Serve:
            Garnish the chili crab with fresh cilantro leaves for a burst of freshness.
            
            10. Serve with lime wedges on the side to add a tangy kick when squeezed over the dish.

            data-good_for = "Good for 4 to 6 person."
            data-procedure="1. Prepare the Pork Belly:
            Cut the pork belly into chunks or pieces of your desired size. The pieces should be about 2-3 inches each for even cooking.
            
            2. Season the Pork Belly:
            In a large pot, combine the pork belly, 1 tablespoon of salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, crushed garlic, and quartered onion.
            Add about 2-3 cups of water to cover the pork belly and bring to a boil over medium heat.
            
            3. Cook the Pork Belly:
            Once the water boils, reduce the heat to low and simmer the pork belly for about 1-1.5 hours, or until the meat is tender. Make sure to check occasionally to see if more water is needed to keep the pork belly submerged.
            During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Stir to combine. This will help infuse more flavor into the pork.
            
            4.Drain and Dry the Pork Belly:
            Once the pork is tender and cooked, remove it from the pot and set it aside. Drain any excess water and let the pork belly pieces cool slightly.
            Pat the pork belly pieces dry using paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. This step is crucial to get a crispy skin when frying.
            
            5. Deep Fry the Pork Belly:
            Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. The oil should be enough to fully submerge the pork belly pieces.
            Once the oil is hot, carefully add the pork belly pieces in batches. Fry the pork for about 5-7 minutes or until the skin turns golden brown and crispy.
            Turn the pieces occasionally to ensure even crispiness on all sides.
            
            6. Season the Lechon Kawali:
            Once the pork belly is crispy and golden, remove the pieces from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
            While still hot, sprinkle the 1/4 cup of salt over the crispy pork belly to season it to taste.
            
            7. Serve:
            Cut the crispy lechon kawali into bite-sized pieces.
            Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce (e.g., vinegar with chili, soy sauce with calamansi, or lechon sauce), steamed rice, and a side of pickled vegetables (achara).

            Beef: Cut the beef chuck or brisket into cubes.
            Vegetables: Peel and slice the carrot and potato into rounds. Chop the onion, tomato, and red bell pepper. Mince the garlic. Slice the green olives and prepare the sweet pickle relish if you are using it.
            
            2. Marinate the Beef:
            In a large bowl, combine the beef cubes with soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaves, ground black pepper, and salt.
            Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes. For more flavor, marinate it for a couple of hours or overnight in the fridge.
            
            3. Sauté the Vegetables:
            Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.
            Once the oil is hot, sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until they become soft and fragrant (about 3-4 minutes).
            Add the chopped tomato and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the tomato softens.
            
            4. Cook the Beef:
            Add the marinated beef cubes to the pot. Brown the beef on all sides, cooking for about 5-7 minutes.
            Add the tomato paste and stir to coat the beef and vegetables evenly. Let it cook for 2 minutes.
                
            5. Add the Broth and Simmer:
            Pour in 1 cup of beef broth, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil.
            Lower the heat and let it simmer, uncovered, for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef becomes tender. Stir occasionally and check if more liquid is needed (you can add more broth or water if it reduces too much).
            
            6. Add the Vegetables:
            Add the sliced carrot and potato rounds to the pot. Let it cook for about 20-25 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
            
            7. Add the Red Bell Pepper, Olives, and Pickles:
            Stir in the sliced red bell pepper, green olives, and sweet pickle relish (if using). Add sugar to balance the acidity if desired.
            Continue simmering for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
            
            8. Thicken the Sauce:
            In a small bowl, dissolve 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in a little cold water (about 2 tablespoons).
            Stir the cornstarch mixture into the pot and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
            
            9. Taste and Adjust:
            Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, or sugar if needed.

            data-procedure="1. Prepare the Chicken and Pork Belly:
            Cut the pork belly into small cubes and the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Make sure the pieces are all uniform in size for even cooking.
            
            2. Season the Chicken:
            In a large mixing bowl, add the cut chicken pieces and minced garlic.
            Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Mix well to ensure the seasoning coats all the pieces evenly.
            
            3. Prepare the Dipping Stations:
            In a shallow bowl, place the all-purpose flour.
            In another shallow bowl, beat the two eggs.
            In a third shallow bowl, place the breadcrumbs (either panko or regular).
            
            4. Coat the Chicken:
            Take each seasoned chicken piece and dredge it in the flour, ensuring it is coated evenly.
            Then, dip the floured chicken piece into the beaten eggs.
            Finally, coat the egg-dipped chicken piece with breadcrumbs, pressing slightly to make sure the breadcrumbs stick well.
            
            5. Fry the Nuggets:
            Heat oil in a large frying pan or deep fryer over medium heat. You want the oil to be hot enough for frying, but not too hot to burn the coating.
            Fry the chicken nuggets in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry each batch for about 3-4 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside and cooked through on the inside.
            Remove the chicken nuggets from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
            
            6. Serve:
            Serve the crispy chicken nuggets with your favorite dipping sauce (such as ketchup, BBQ sauce, or honey mustard).">

            data-procedure="1. Cook the Macaroni:
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat.
            Add the elbow macaroni to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions, usually for about 8-10 minutes, or until al dente.
            Drain the cooked macaroni and set it aside.
            
            2. Prepare the Cheese Sauce:
            In a separate saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat.
            Once the butter is melted, add the all-purpose flour to the pan. Whisk constantly for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture forms a paste (known as a roux). This will help thicken your sauce.
            
            3. Add Milk:
            Slowly pour in the milk while continuing to whisk to prevent lumps from forming. Keep whisking until the mixture is smooth.
            Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently. Allow it to cook for about 3-5 minutes, until the sauce thickens.
            
            4. Season the Sauce:
            Add the salt, pepper, and paprika (if using) to the sauce. Stir to combine.
            Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, reduce the heat to low.
            
            5. Add Cheese:
            Gradually add the shredded cheddar cheese to the sauce, stirring until it’s completely melted and smooth.
            Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed.
            
            6. Combine Macaroni and Cheese Sauce:
            Add the cooked and drained macaroni to the cheese sauce. Stir until the macaroni is evenly coated with the cheese sauce.
            If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a splash of milk to reach your desired consistency.
            
            7. Serve:
            Serve the macaroni and cheese hot. You can garnish with a sprinkle of additional paprika, fresh herbs, or extra cheese if desired.">

            In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. This will ensure they are well-mixed and will make your pancakes light and fluffy.
            
            2. Mix the Wet Ingredients:
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter until the mixture is smooth and fully combined.
            
            3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:
            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a wooden spoon or whisk until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it’s okay if the batter is a little lumpy.
            
            4. Heat the Pan:
            Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter to coat the surface (you can also use oil if preferred).
            
            5. Cook the Pancakes:
            Once the pan is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake.
            Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges begin to look set. Flip the pancake carefully and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.

            data-procedure="1. Activate the Yeast:
            In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast.
            Stir the mixture gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This ensures that the yeast is active.
            
            2. Make the Dough:
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
            Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture.
            Stir the ingredients together until a dough starts to form.
            Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour as needed.
            
            3. Let the Dough Rise:
            Grease a large bowl with a little olive oil and place the dough in the bowl.
            Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.
            Allow the dough to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
            
            4. Prepare the Pizza Base:
            Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
            Once the dough has risen, punch it down to remove the air bubbles.
            Divide the dough into smaller portions if you are making multiple pizzas, or keep it whole for one large pizza.
            Roll the dough out on a floured surface to your desired shape and thickness (typically about 12 inches in diameter for a standard pizza).
            
            5. Assemble the Pizza:
            Place the rolled-out dough on a greased pizza stone or baking sheet.
            Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
            Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
            Add your desired toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.).
            
            6. Bake the Pizza:
            Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
            
            7. Serve:
            Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.

            Lay out the spring roll wrappers on a flat surface, one at a time. Make sure they are dry and not torn.
            
            2. Prepare the Cheese:
            Take the sticks of mozzarella or cheddar cheese. If the cheese sticks are too long, cut them into smaller pieces that will fit neatly inside the spring roll wrappers.
            
            3. Wrap the Cheese:
            Place one stick of cheese near the edge of a spring roll wrapper.
            Carefully roll the wrapper around the cheese stick, folding the sides in as you go, just like you would wrap a spring roll.
            Once wrapped, lightly brush the edge of the wrapper with the beaten egg to seal it securely. The egg acts as glue to keep the wrapper closed.
            
            4. Heat the Oil:
            In a deep frying pan or pot, heat cooking oil over medium heat. Make sure there is enough oil to submerge the cheese sticks, or at least enough to cover them halfway. The oil should be hot but not smoking. A temperature of around 350°F (175°C) is ideal for frying.
            
            5. Fry the Cheese Sticks:
            Carefully place the wrapped cheese sticks into the hot oil, a few at a time, without overcrowding the pan. Fry them for about 2 to 3 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides.
            Use tongs or a slotted spoon to turn the cheese sticks as needed to ensure they cook evenly.
            
            6. Drain the Excess Oil:
            Once the cheese sticks are golden and crispy, carefully remove them from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.
                
            7.Serve:
            Once drained, serve the cheese sticks hot. They are delicious on their own, but you can also serve them with optional dipping sauces like marinara sauce or ranch dressing.">

            2. Prepare the Muffin Tin:
            Grease a muffin tin with olive oil or use cooking spray to ensure the egg muffins don’t stick to the pan. You can also line the muffin tin with paper liners if you prefer.
            
            3. Prepare the Ingredients:
            Dice the bell peppers and onions into small pieces.
            If using spinach, chop it into smaller pieces. You can use fresh spinach or frozen spinach (make sure it’s cooked and drained if frozen).

            Mix in the shredded cheese into the egg mixture. You can reserve a little cheese to sprinkle on top of the muffins for a cheesy crust.
            
            7. Fill the Muffin Tin:
            Pour the egg mixture into the muffin tin cups, filling each cup about 3/4 of the way full.
            If you reserved cheese, sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the muffins for a golden, cheesy finish.
            
            8. Bake the Egg Muffins:
            Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for about 18–22 minutes or until the eggs are set and lightly golden on top. You can test if they’re done by inserting a toothpick — it should come out clean.
            
            9. Cool and Serve:
            Let the egg muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes before removing them. Use a spoon or knife to gently lift them out.
            Serve warm, and enjoy your egg muffins! They can also be stored in the fridge for a few days and reheated when ready to eat.">

            Tomato slices,

            Ketchup, mustard, or your favorite sauce"
            data-good_for = "Good for 4 person."
            data-procedure="1. Prepare the ingredients:
            Slice the onion into thin rings.
            Slice the tomato into round slices.
            Wash and dry the lettuce leaves.
            If you are using pickles, slice them into thin rounds.
            Have your cheese slices, hamburger buns, and condiments (ketchup, mustard, etc.) ready for assembly.
            
            2. Form the burger patties:
            Take the ground beef and divide it into four equal portions (around 1/4 lb or 112g each).
            Shape each portion into a round patty that’s slightly larger than the hamburger bun, as the patty will shrink while cooking.
            Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper.
            
            3. Grill the patties:
            Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.
            Once hot, place the burger patties on the grill. Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your preferred level of doneness (4 minutes for medium, 5-6 minutes for well-done).
            During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty and close the grill lid to melt the cheese.
            
            4. Toast the buns:
            While the patties are cooking, slice the hamburger buns in half and toast them lightly on the grill or in a toaster. This will give the buns a crispy texture.
            
            5. Assemble the burger:
            Place the bottom half of the toasted bun on a plate.
            Place the cooked patty with melted cheese on the bottom bun.
            Add a few slices of onion on top of the cheese.
            Add a couple of slices of tomato and a few lettuce leaves.
            If you like pickles, place a few slices on the burger.
            Drizzle ketchup, mustard, or your favorite sauce on top.
            Place the top half of the toasted bun to complete the burger.
            
            6. Serve and enjoy:

            data-procedure="1 Preheat the Oven:
            Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal of the brownies.
            
            2. Melt the Butter:
            In a microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop, melt 1/2 cup of unsalted butter. Let it cool slightly.
            
            3. Mix Sugar and Butter:
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar. Stir until fully combined.
            
            4. Add Eggs and Vanilla:
            Crack the 2 large eggs into the bowl with the butter and sugar mixture. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Whisk everything together until smooth and well-mixed.
            
            5. Combine Dry Ingredients:
            In a separate bowl, whisk together 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder. Make sure there are no lumps in the cocoa powder.
            
            6. Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:
            Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix. If you’re using chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this point.
            
            7. Pour Into the Baking Pan:
            Pour the brownie batter into your prepared 8x8-inch baking pan. Spread it evenly to ensure uniform baking.
            
            8. Bake the Brownies:
            Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. To check for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the brownies. If it comes out with just a few moist crumbs (not wet batter), the brownies are done.
            
            9. Cool and Serve:
            Let the brownies cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before cutting them into squares. For a cleaner cut, you can refrigerate the brownies for a bit.">

            In a large mixing bowl, combine the 2 cups of all-purpose cream, 1 cup of condensed milk, and 1 cup of fresh milk.
            If you prefer a sweeter taste, you can add 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir well until everything is fully combined and smooth.
            
            3. Prepare the Graham Cracker Base:
            In a baking dish (preferably an 8x8-inch square or a similar size), start by placing a layer of graham crackers at the bottom.
            You can break the crackers into smaller pieces if needed to cover the bottom of the dish completely.
            
            4. Assemble the Mango Float:
            Spread a layer of the cream mixture over the graham crackers, enough to cover them completely.
            Then, arrange a layer of the sliced mangoes on top of the cream mixture.
            Repeat this layering process (graham crackers, cream mixture, mango slices) until you have used up all the ingredients. Make sure the top layer is the cream mixture.

            Cover the dish with plastic wrap or aluminum foil.
            Place the mango float in the refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to firm up.

            1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk,

            data-good_for = "Good for 8 to 10 person."
            data-procedure="1. Prepare the Caramel:
            In a saucepan, add 1 cup of granulated sugar over medium heat.
            Let the sugar melt, swirling the pan occasionally. Be careful not to stir it with a spoon, as it may crystallize.
            Once the sugar has melted and turned a golden amber color, immediately pour it into your flan mold or a round baking dish. Tilt the mold to evenly coat the bottom with the caramelized sugar.
            Allow the caramel to cool and harden while you prepare the flan mixture.
            
            2. Prepare the Flan Mixture:
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the 10 egg yolks with the sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk.
            Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mixture.
            Whisk everything together gently. Try to avoid creating too many bubbles or froth while whisking.
            
            3. Strain the Mixture:
            To achieve a smooth and silky texture, pour the flan mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into another bowl. This will remove any unwanted bits from the egg yolks.
            
            4. Pour the Mixture into the Mold:
            After straining, carefully pour the flan mixture into the prepared mold (which already has the hardened caramel).
            Tap the mold gently on the counter to release any air bubbles.
            
            5. Bake the Leche Flan:
            Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
            Place the mold into a larger baking pan. Add hot water into the outer pan (around 1 to 2 inches deep) to create a water bath, which will help cook the flan gently.
            Bake the flan for 45-60 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a knife or toothpick into the center of the flan. If it comes out clean, the flan is done. If it’s still runny, bake for a few more minutes.
            
            6. Cool and Refrigerate:
            Once done, remove the flan from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
            After cooling, cover the flan and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to let it set properly.
            
            7. Serve the Leche Flan:
            To remove the flan from the mold, run a knife around the edges of the mold to loosen it.
            Invert the mold onto a serving plate, and gently lift it off. The caramel will have formed a rich syrup that will coat the flan.

            data-procedure="1. Prepare the Fresh Fruits:
            Wash the fresh fruits (e.g., strawberries, grapes, pineapple, and mango) thoroughly.
            Cut the strawberries into slices, grapes in halves, and peel and dice the pineapple and mango into bite-sized pieces.

            3. Prepare the Creamy Dressing:
            In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream (or use whipped cream if you are using pre-whipped) until it thickens slightly. If using heavy cream, you can add a little sugar for extra sweetness if desired.
            To the whipped cream, add the condensed milk and mix well until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.
            
            4. Combine Fruits and Cream:
            Pour the creamy dressing over the mixed fresh fruits and canned fruit cocktail in the large mixing bowl.

            5. Add Optional Ingredients:
            If using shredded coconut, sprinkle it over the fruit salad and toss gently to combine.
            If you’re using raisins, add them to the salad and mix them in.
            
            6. Chill the Fruit Salad:
            Once everything is well-mixed, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid.
            Place the fruit salad in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours to allow the flavors to meld together and the salad to chill.

            In a large saucepan or pot, combine 4 cups of coconut milk, 1 cup of evaporated milk, and 1 cup of condensed milk. Stir well to mix all the liquids together.
            
            2. Add Sugar:
            Add 1/2 cup of sugar into the mixture and stir continuously to dissolve the sugar completely. You may adjust the sugar based on your sweetness preference.
            
            3. Mix Cornstarch:
            In a small bowl, dissolve 1 cup of cornstarch in 1/2 cup of cold water (you can also use coconut milk if you want to enhance the flavor). Stir until the cornstarch is completely dissolved, creating a slurry.

            6. Pour into Molds:
            Once the mixture has thickened, remove the pan from the heat. Pour the thickened mixture into a mold or a baking dish. Use a spatula to spread it evenly and smooth the surface.
            
            7. Chill:
            Allow the Maja Blanca to cool at room temperature. Once it is no longer hot, refrigerate it for at least 3-4 hours or until fully set. It will firm up as it cools.
            
            8. Top with Grated Cheese:
            Once the Maja Blanca is set, sprinkle 1/4 cup of grated cheese on top. This adds a nice savory contrast to the sweetness of the pudding.
            
            9. Serve:

            10. Optional Topping (Grated Cheese):
            If you saved grated cheese for the topping, sprinkle it over the cake during the last 10 minutes of baking and continue baking until the cheese melts and turns golden.

            Add egg yolk and water: In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg yolk. Add it to the flour and butter mixture. Then, slowly add cold water one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together.
            Chill the dough: Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, form it into a disc, and wrap it tightly. Chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour.
            
            2. Prepare the Tart Shells
            Roll out the dough: Once the dough has chilled, lightly flour your work surface and roll the dough out to about 1/8 inch thick. Use a rolling pin to roll it into a circle large enough to fit your tart pans (mini or one large tart pan).
            Fit the dough into pans: Carefully place the dough into the tart pans, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough along the edges.
            Chill again: Place the prepared tart shells back into the fridge for about 15 minutes to set. This helps prevent shrinkage during baking.
            
            3. Bake the Tart Crusts
            Preheat oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            Blind bake: Line each tart shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the crusts for 10-12 minutes. Then, remove the parchment paper and weights and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes until the crust is golden brown.
            Cool the crusts: Remove from the oven and allow the tart shells to cool completely on a wire rack.
            
            4. Make the Chocolate Filling
            Heat the cream: In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it begins to simmer. Be careful not to let it boil.
            Melt the chocolate: Remove the cream from the heat and immediately add the chopped dark chocolate. Let it sit for a minute, then stir until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth.
            Add butter: Stir in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter until fully incorporated, making the filling smooth and shiny.
            
            5. Assemble the Tarts
            Fill the tart shells: Once the tart crusts are cooled, spoon the chocolate filling into each tart shell, smoothing the top with a spatula.
            Chill the tarts: Place the filled tarts in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or until the chocolate filling is set.
            
            6. Add Optional Toppings
            Garnish: Just before serving, add your choice of toppings to the tarts. You can add a dollop of whipped cream, fresh berries, or a sprinkling of chocolate shavings for an extra touch of flavor and decoration.">

            data-procedure="1. Preheat the oven:
            Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the macaroons from sticking.
            
            2. Mix the coconut base:
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the 2 ½ cups of shredded coconut, 2/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir them together until the mixture is well combined. The mixture should be thick and sticky.
            
            3. Whip the egg whites:
            In a separate clean bowl, beat the 2 large egg whites and ¼ teaspoon of salt using a hand mixer or stand mixer. Beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. This usually takes around 3-4 minutes. The egg whites should be glossy and hold their shape when the beaters are lifted.
            
            4. Fold the egg whites into the coconut mixture:
            Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the coconut mixture using a spatula. Do this carefully to preserve the airiness of the egg whites. Make sure the mixture is fully combined but avoid over-mixing.
            
            5. Shape the macaroons:
            Using a spoon or cookie scoop, form small mounds of the coconut mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Each mound should be about 1 ½ inches in diameter, and you can lightly press them into shape. Space them about 1 inch apart.
            
            6. Bake:
            Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops of the macaroons are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking.
            
            7. Cool:
            Once the macaroons are golden, remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. Afterward, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

            In a mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt and heavy cream. Whisk until smooth and well combined.
            
            2. Sweeten the mixture:
            Add the honey (or maple syrup) and vanilla extract to the yogurt and cream mixture. Stir well to incorporate all the ingredients.
            
            3. Add salt:

            If you are using fruit (berries or mango), blend the fruit until smooth in a blender or food processor. Gently fold the pureed fruit into the yogurt mixture for a burst of flavor. If you prefer, you can leave the fruit in small chunks for added texture.
            
            5. Chill the mixture:
            Place the mixture in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to chill. This will help the frozen yogurt have a smoother texture once frozen.

            If you don’t have an ice cream maker, pour the yogurt mixture into a shallow container, and spread it out evenly. Place it in the freezer and stir the mixture every 30 minutes with a fork for the first 2-3 hours to break up any ice crystals until it reaches the desired texture.
            
            8. Serve:
            Once the frozen yogurt has reached your desired consistency (smooth and creamy), serve it immediately for a soft-serve texture, or freeze it for another 1-2 hours for a firmer consistency.
